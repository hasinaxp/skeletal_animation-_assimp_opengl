# OPENGL SKELETAL ANIMATION WITH ASSIMP

  this is a demo project that shows how to do skeletal or skin animation using assimp, glm, and opengl.
  
  
## NOTES
- I have used stb_image.h library to load texture image
- This demo assumes that the model has only one mesh and texture. But for more meshes the process is almost same.
